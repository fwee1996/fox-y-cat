The Fetch "http request"

fetch("https://indoatlantis.com/rest_api/last_transaction")

The Conversion
.then(response => response.json())

The first then() function waits until the response is received and converts the string:
"{"odr_id": "27", "odr_usr_id": "4", "odr_status": "Ordered"}"

into a JavaScript object:
{
    "odr_id": "27",
    "odr_usr_id": "4",
    "odr_status": "Ordered"
}


The Action
The second then() is automatically invoked by JavaScript once the conversion process is complete. The converted data is automatically passed as an argument when it is invoked.

    .then(
        (convertedData) => {
            /*
                Here, and only here, is where you can do something
                with the data that you requested.
            */
        }
    )






Alt: define the action function separately, and pass the reference to the second then().

const handleConvertedData = (convertedData) => {
    /*
        Here, and only here, is where you can do something
        with the data that you requested.
    */
}

fetch("https://indoatlantis.com/rest_api/last_transaction")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(handleConvertedData)
